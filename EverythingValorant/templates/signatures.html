      <p> Signature abilities tend to be on the weaker side when it comes to what they
          can do within a round. This is because every agent gets one free ability charge
          at the start of every round. Some agents have additional charges that can be
          purchased for credits, commonly agents with smokes. All duelists have 1 ability             charge which can be replenished by getting 2 kills within a round. Most other 
          agents' ability charges replenish after a set amount of time. When the recharge
          time has elapsed, the agent receives a temporary charge that cannot be carried
          over into the next round.
