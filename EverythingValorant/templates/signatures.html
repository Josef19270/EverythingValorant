      <p> Signature abilities are abilities that agents are guaranteed to be able to use every round. Each agent has at least one signature ability that will give them one free charge for them to use.
        </p>
        <p>Some agents may be able to increase the amount of charges they have of their signature ability by buying more with credits, but any regenerated charges from cooldowns will not be kept for the next round and they will restart with their one free charge. Charges that do not get used and did not get regenerated will be carried over to the next round, however a new charge will not be added. Signature abilities that don't offer the option to buy more charges have other ways to allow the player to use that ability more than once in a round, such as cooldowns or enemy kill targets.
